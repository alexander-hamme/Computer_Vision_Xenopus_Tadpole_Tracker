# computer-vision-xenopus-tadpole-tracker
Program with OpenCV (Python / C++) and Tensorflow that tracks and records data of *Xenopus laevis* tadpoles. 

Will use Faster R-CNN algorithm with retrained neural network image classifier for tadpole detection. 

In addition to detection, tracking is the other major challenge to be solved- will construct decision tree classifiers / kNN / similar machine learning algorithms for trajectory prediction and correction. 

Project is in collaboration with neuroscience researchers at Bard College.
