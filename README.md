# computer-vision-xenopus-tadpole-tracker
Program with OpenCV (Python and C++) that tracks and records data of Xenopus laevis tadpoles. Using Tensorflow to train neural network for tadpole image classifier and construct decision trees / kNN to improve trajectory prediction. 

Project is in collaboration with neuroscience researchers at Bard College.
